## General Information
- Provided data set with all the data for analysis between target variables and indepedent variables
- Read the data and check for categorical and numerical data.
- Check for the target variable and convert the categorical data with dummy variables
- Deduce on the relationship between variables  
- Describing model, Rescaling variables, build the model and check for the parameter values  
- Test the model, predict and evaluate the model
- Check the model using RFE method
- Analyse on error terms and other assumptions related to Linear Regression to conclude that it is the best model 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temp variable has high correlation with the target variable cnt
- The model has target variable cnt and it depends on 12 variables except atemp and mnth
- Residual plot is normally distributed
- The final model generated or build creates a linear regression model
